Microsoft Excel is a popular spreadsheet software developed by Microsoft. It is part of the Microsoft Office suite and is widely used for organizing, analyzing, and manipulating numerical data. Excel provides a grid-like interface where users can create worksheets, enter data into cells, and perform various calculations and data analysis tasks. It offers a range of functions, formulas, and formatting options to manage data efficiently, create charts and graphs, and automate tasks through macros. Excel is commonly used in businesses, educational institutions, and research settings for tasks such as financial analysis, budgeting, data tracking, and statistical analysis.
Microsoft Excel supports multiple file formats for saving and importing data. Here are some of the common formats used with Excel:

1. Excel Workbook (.xlsx): This is the default and most widely used format for Excel files. It supports multiple sheets, formulas, formatting, and various other features.

2. Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (.xlsm): This format is similar to the .xlsx format but allows the inclusion of macros (programmed automation) within the workbook.

3. Excel Binary Workbook (.xlsb): This format is a binary version of the Excel workbook. It is more compact and can be faster to open and save compared to other formats. It supports all Excel features.

4. Excel 97-2003 Workbook (.xls): This is an older format compatible with older versions of Excel. It has limitations compared to the newer formats but can still be used to open and save Excel files.

5. Comma-Separated Values (.csv): CSV is a plain text format where each value is separated by a comma. Although it is not an Excel-specific format, Excel can import and export CSV files. However, CSV files do not support formulas, multiple sheets, or formatting.

Apart from these, Excel can also work with other file formats like XML Spreadsheet (.xml), Excel Template (.xltx), and more. It also has the capability to import data from databases, web pages, and other external sources.
